This project was made using PyCharm, Python, Selenium, Webdriver, PyTest, UnitTest and Page Object Model (POM).  
Initially, I was planning to write test cases only for www.sephora.com, but I ran into a problem, because this site is using "reCAPTCHA". So, when I got a "reCAPTCHA" while executing a test case, I would write it for an automation practice site: http://tutorialsninja.com/demo/index.php?route=common/home  
That's why you'll find a test case named "test_case_01.py" and another test case named "test_case_07_ninja.py".  
This project contains test cases only for the main functionality of the www.sephora.com
